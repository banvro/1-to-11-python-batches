# Control Statments : are those statments, which control the flow of execution of a program.

# Condational Statments:
    # if elif else
    

# comparission operator

# 1) ==

# print(11 == 10)

# 2) >
# 3) <
# 4) <=
# 5) >=

# print(10 < 4)


# 10 + 20

# operands = 10, 20
# operator = +

# Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".








# Loops : loops are used for ittrations/ repetation.

# 1) For Loop
# 2) While Loop

# 1) For loop : 


# lst = [10, 20, 89, 7, 8, 6, 10]

# for varible in data_source:
#     # block of code

# for a in lst:
#     print(a)
#     print("hello.....")



# range()

# range(start, end, increment):

# start = 0
# end = n - 1
# increment = 1

# for i in range(3, 15):
#     print(i)




# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# 2 x 3 = 6
# .
# .
# .
# .
# 2 x 10 = 20



# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print("2 x", i, "=", 2*i)
